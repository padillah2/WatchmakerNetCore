# WatchmakerNetCore

This repository now consists of two different programs inspired by Richard Dawkins book "[The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design][BWAmazon]".

## BiomorphNetcore

This project was started to replicate the Biomorph program mentioned in Richard Dawkins book. I found several versions on the internet but none were faithful to the book and none expounded nor explained themselves so they worked (poorly) without describing their inner workings.

Currently this works but fails to mutate genes 4 - 7. I am working on a better design that randomly chooses a number of genes to mutate and then mutates them. This is contrary to Dawkins representation which I hope to come back to at a later date.

## WeaselProgram

This project was started to replicate the "Weasel program" mentioned in Richard Dawkins book. I didn't find any examples of this on the internet and found writiing it fascinating.
